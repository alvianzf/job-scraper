		• Collaborate with our team to prepare for interviews, ensuring you’re equipped with the technical background needed for success.
	
	What We’re Looking For
		• Fluent or native English speaker with exceptional communication and interpersonal skills.
		• Basic to mid-level understanding of web2/web3, mobile, or game development technologies.

		• Reliable, adaptable, and committed to building long-term working relationships.
	
	Why Join Us?
		• Exciting Opportunities: Work with international clients and contribute to innovative projects across industries.
		• Competitive Compensation: $2K of income after getting a first-time job as a result of the interviews.
		• Supportive Environment: Full technical preparation and support for client interviews and meetings.
		• Long-Term Collaboration: Join a team that values your skills and contributions, offering opportunities for long-term growth and partnership.

		1. We’ll initiate communication with clients and share the project details with you.
		2. You’ll attend client interviews and meetings using profiles that we provide.
		3. We’ll provide full technical support and preparation, ensuring you are confident and ready for each interaction.

THIS PROJECT IS OUTSIDE IR35

About the Role:
We are seeking 3-4 highly skilled Senior/Expert Scrum Masters with a strong IT and development background to join our client's dynamic team. This is a critical role where you will facilitate Agile processes, drive delivery, and help development teams achieve their sprint goals.

This is not a Business Scrum Master role - we're looking for hands-on IT project leaders who can guide technical teams to success in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.

Key Responsibilities:
Facilitate Scrum ceremonies (Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Reviews, Retrospectives).
Help teams deliver high-quality software by removing obstacles and optimizing workflows.
Support and challenge the team to foster continuous improvement and self-organization.
Collaborate closely with Product Owners, stakeholders, and developers.
Manage team capacity, velocity, and Agile metrics using tools like Jira.
Ensure the delivery of the Definition of Done (DoD) and maintain sprint backlogs.
Act as an ambassador of Agile methodologies within the organization.
Handle risk & issue management, proactively resolving blockers to keep projects on track.

What We're Looking For in as a minimum:
Proven Experience:
Senior-level experience as a Scrum Master in IT/Development teams (not infrastructure).

Agile Expertise:

Our client, a leader in the aerospace sector, is seeking a dynamic and motivated Mechanical Analyst to support structural developments for current and future spacecraft missions. This is a hands-on role combining structural analysis, environmental testing, and systems engineering to ensure the mechanical integrity of flight hardware and sub-systems.

You'll be part of our Structure and Propulsion team, working closely with project managers, design engineers, systems engineers, and principal engineers throughout the product life cycle - from analysis to qualification and launch.

Key Responsibilities:
 Perform quasi-static and dynamic finite element analyses and produce structural margins of safety using FEA tools and hand calculations.
 Create and refine FE models of spacecraft components and structures using tools such as Nastran, HyperMesh, and Ansys Workbench.
 Select suitable materials and surface treatments for structural components, particularly for metallic and composite materials.
 Support and attend environmental test campaigns, including vibration and static testing - both within the UK and occasionally overseas.
 Validate and correlate analytical models using experimental data from tests to improve accuracy and reliability.
 Develop mechanical environmental envelopes based on launch requirements, analysis, and test data.
 Maintain accurate mass properties, including centre of gravity and moment of inertia estimates.
 Produce high-quality technical reports and analysis documentation.

What We're Looking For:

Essential:
 Proven experience in structural analysis in a high-precision, low-volume environment such as aerospace, space, or motorsport.
 Proficiency with structural analysis tools including Nastran, HyperMesh, SmartOffice, Ansys Workbench, and MATLAB.
 Strong hand-stressing and FEA skills, with a sound understanding of engineering fundamentals.
 Experience working with both metallic and composite structures.
 Experience in vibration/static testing and thermo-elastic analysis.

Desirable:
 Familiarity with spacecraft systems and structural design constraints in the space environment.
 Competence with 3D CAD systems such as SolidWorks.
 Excellent communication and documentation skills, including interaction with project teams and external stakeholders.
